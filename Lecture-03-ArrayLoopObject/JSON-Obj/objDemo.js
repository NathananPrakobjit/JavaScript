// How can you represent real-world objects in code?
// They have associated attributes = object PROPERTIES
// They have associated actions = object METHIODS
// They have associated context = "this"


// First:
//Let's define a simple object (with no properties or methods)
const blank = {};
console.log("Blank Type:",typeof blank);
console.log("Blank value",blank);


/*
// Next:
// Let's define an object with PROPERTIES (attributes)
// Obhject are jest a collection of name-value pairs
// separated by commas
const book = {
    title : "1984",
    author: "Geroge Orwell",
    isAvailable: false
};
